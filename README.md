Brain teaser 4
Q.1. a lecturer of an institution has his phd projects on some of the basic rudiments of pythonn this projects were majorly focused on data types
the lecturer created six different types of variables each of these variables ends with id referencing those data types at line 50 the lecturer decided to work on the interpreter section making use of the context isinstance 
determine the boolean value of each of the variables

2. a car dealer whose store is situated deeply inside of mushin, ladipo has varieties of car types ranging from toyota to Benz there are 7 different cars in the car dealers shop, each of these cars are situated with the context type, one of the cars named Mercedes-Benz is of a string class the other car toyota camry has a floating point the next car which is G-wagon has an undefined class,, create a rep of the other classes of cars in the dealers shop

A.1. #compiler
str_id = 'string'
float_id = 2.0002
int_id = 34
str2_id = 'fortune'
float2_id = 0.003
int2_id = 90
# interpreter
print(isinstance(str_id, str))
print(isinstance(float_id, float))
print(isinstance(int_id, int))
print(isinstance(str2_id, str))
print(isinstance(float2_id, float))
print(isinstance(int2_id, int))

2. mercedes_benz = 'benz'
camry = 9.44
lexus = 45
bmw = 'dr'
audi = 30
lambo = 4.6
print(type(camry))
print(type(mercedes_benz))
print(type(bmw))
print(type(audi))
print(type(lambo))
print(type(g_wagon))
print(type(lexus))
